# 🔥 Flame On!

Welcome to **Flame On**, a small project I built while taking my very first steps into the world of game development using Flutter and the Flame engine.

## 👋 About This Project
I've been working with Flutter for a while, but game engines always felt like a bit of a mystery to me. I finally decided to sit down and try to understand the basics—how a game loop works, how components interact, and how to handle collisions.

It's nothing fancy and definitely not a "full" game yet, but it was a great way for me to get familiar with the engine and see how different the mindset is compared to building standard apps.

## 🕹️ The Vibe
It's a very basic space shooter. You control a ship, dodge some red alien invaders, and try to get a high score. Simple as that!

## 🧠 What I Explored
Since this was a learning exercise, I focused on the core fundamentals:
- **The Game Loop**: Getting used to `update(dt)` instead of just building static layouts.
- **Components**: Seeing how everything (Player, Enemy, Bullet) can be managed as separate entities.
- **Collisions**: Learning how to make the game react when two things hit each other.
- **Basic Scaling**: Adding a little bit of challenge by increasing enemy spawns over time.

## 🎮 How to Play
- **Touch**: Just drag your ship around the screen. It auto-fires because I wanted it to feel smooth on a real device.

### 🛠️ Tech Used
- **Flutter** & **Flame Engine**
- Some simple pixel art to bring it to life.

### ✌️ Final Thoughts
This was just a "see what I can do" project to break the ice with Flame. It's modest, but it was a lot of fun to build and definitely made me respect the work that goes into even the simplest games!
